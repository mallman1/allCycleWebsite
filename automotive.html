        <h2>What is an Automotive Recyclable?</h2>
        <article>
          Automotive Recyclables are almost any item on the vehicle, or even the vehicle itself.
        </article>
        
        <h2>Metal Parts</h2>
        <article>
          Any metal part from your vehicle is fundamentally recyclable. In certain cases some parts may even fit within the guidelines of your curbside recycling program. Some statewide guidelines require the object weigh less than 336 pounds, fit in the bin with the lid completely closed, and not contain any fluids (oil, antifreeze, etc). This leaves open the possibility for such various damaged/worn metal scrap as headlight bezels, side mirrors, door handles, etc. This however usually does not include mufflers, catalytic converters, brake shoes, and spark plugs. Larger pieces of scrap metal (steel wheels, doors, fenders, radiators, etc.) can also be brought to your local salvage/wreckage yard, occasionally for a small cash reward.

        <h2>Liquids</h2>
        <article>
          Most liquids in a vehicle are not recyclable, but Motor Oil is.
          The number one recyclable part on your vehicle is its oil. Conventional motor oils are reliable for three months by most automotive standards. Synthetic oils will last a bit longer, but they can also be more expensive. Either way your vehicle goes through a lot of oil over a years time. If you take your vehicle to a service shop to have its oil changed, it should be getting recycled already, but if you do the work yourself, be sure to bring the used oil to your nearest recycling center.

        <h2>Tires</h2>
        <article>
          Probably the next most recyclable part on a vehicle is its tires. Tires take up a lot of room in landfills and are not exactly biodegradable. Your best bet is to bring them to your nearest recycle center once they have used up the last of their useful life. From here they will be turned into any number of things, such as fuel, artificial playground turf, or various other products.

        <h2>Batteries</h2>
        <article>
          It is essential that you are recycling every single one of your vehicles batteries. Not only is the lead found within the battery extremely toxic, it is also just too easy to properly recycle a used battery. In the US, most states have a take back law which offers a cash/money incentive for the exchange of any old battery for a new one.
