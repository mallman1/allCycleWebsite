        <h2>Why Recycling is Important</h2>
        <article>
          Recycling is one of the best ways for you to have a positive impact on the world in which we live. Recycling is important to both the natural environment and us. We must act fast as the amount of waste we create is increasing all the time.
          <br>
          The amount of waste we create is constantly increasing because:
          <ul>
            <li>Increasing wealth means that people are buying more products and ultimately creating more waste.</li>
            <li>Increasing population means that there are more people on the planet to create waste.</li>
            <li>New packaging and technological products are being developed, much of these products contain materials that are not biodegradable.</li>
            <li>New lifestyle changes, such as eating fast food, means that we create additional waste that isnâ€™t biodegradable.</li>
          </ul>
